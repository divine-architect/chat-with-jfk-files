# chat-with-jfk-files
A web application that let's you chat with the recently released files related to JFK's assassination investigation

## About
The website provides an interface for anyone to chat with the JFK investigation 2025 release files.<br>
It contains over 2300+ files. I've managed to convert all the .pdf to .txt via OCR (will be releasing soon)

Built using chromaDB, python and htmx.
